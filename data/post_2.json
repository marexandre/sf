      "body": "Tacx just announced the Neo Smart trainer. Looks to be very similar to the Wahoo Kickr. I've been thinking about getting a trainer and the Wahoo Kickr was my top choice. The Neo Smart is giving me second thoughts. I like the fact the Neo Smart is able to simulate downhills with the built in motor, if I'm understanding the hype correctly. Any thoughts comments? ",

      "body": "I'm very interested in people's thoughts about this too. \nI'm also close to pulling the trigger on a Kickr but wondering whether perhaps it's worth waiting for/spending more on the Neo. \n\nI don't care much about the pedalling downhill capability. \n\nThe perceived advantages of the Neo to me are: \n1. Quiet \n2. Rocking action \n3. 'True direct drive' may mean higher accuracy, less drift, longer wearing \n\nThe perceived disadvantages of the Neo to me: \n1. Relatively unproven - may have teething problems with software rtf \n2. Relatively unproven - may turn out to have other issues",
