Thus, I have a few questions for everyone who is far more knowledgeable than I. \n\n1. Would a crank-based power meter (e.g., Power2Max) work indoors on a CyleOps Fluid trainer? \n2. Do any power meters work indoors on a CycleOps Fluid trainer? \n3. Is there a trainer (or quasi roller system) for $500 or less that would allow me to use a power meter (assuming I sold the CycleOps)? \n4. If no power meter will work on a trainer, what accessories do I need to buy in order to simulate power indoors? \n\nAnd the \"catch-all\" question: \n\n5. If I were to buy a power2max or other crank-based power meter, what option would you recommend for training with power indoors? \n\nI suppose I should apologize in the event any (or all) of the above questions are completely stupid. \n\nThanks!",
