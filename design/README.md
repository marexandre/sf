# Forum
Main focus for design was to maintain the look/design with the exciting Strava website, when a user is logged in, and not to do redesign or add too much new look/design so it naturally fits into the existing site.

By having icons for categories makes it visually easy to quickly find the topic you want to read/post about.
Added Active and Archived tabs so the forum top page could be kept simple. After a challenges is finished after couple of month I believe not many users would be active.

By having a similar look and structure as the forum top page users should easily understand the UI. Made "Create Post" Strava orange so it's more noticeable that user can add posts.
By having the users icon/image an the most left would provide a better visual information on who's post it is, if you see your friend or a user your following you would be more likely to read the post.

Might be nice:
- Add some icon that indicates there are new unread post
- On post tile hover show post summary in a popover
- On "Last Update" user block, show the latest post in a popover
- Some kind of filtering for posts

## [Post Detail](003_Post_Detail.png)

Kept the same feel and design from above links. Each user has an nuder under their icon, which is an kudos count, similar indicator as on Stack Overflow if that user has good reputation and if his answers could be trusted.

Might be nice for the right panel:
- Show a list of users whom wrote comments
- Show tag list
- Show all added images in a list

##### Design Inspiration

Kept the same feel and design from above link. Not really sure if to keep tags.

Might be nice:
- Drag and drop for photo upload
- Have an rich editor for posting comments
- Some rules or tips for writing posts
- Add users for discussion
